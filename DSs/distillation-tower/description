	Description:
Snapshot measurements on 27 variables from a distillation column; measured over 2.5 years.

	Data source:
From an industrial source; variable names have been coded. e.g. Temp1 is a temperature, but we cannot disclose where it is measured on the column. 
* Temperatures are in Fahrenheit
* Pressures are measured in bars
* FlowC1 in units of MSCFD
* FlowC3 and FlowC4 are in units of MBPD
* Temp11 = Temp3 - Temp9 = the temperature increase of the stream leaving the column and returning back, after passing through the reboiler
* InvTemp tags are 1000/temperature, therefore with units of inverted Fahrenheit
* The last column, VapourPressure, is a quality variable measured in the laboratory. The other snapshot measurements in the row correspond to the process conditions when the sample was taken. 

	Data shape:
253 rows and 27 columns
